Personal Task Manager is a simple command-line-based task management system that allows users to organize their tasks efficiently. Users can sign up, log in, view their tasks, add new tasks, update task status, and view task status.

## Python Concepts Used and Learn:

- **File Handling:** Utilized file handling to store user information and task data in text files.

- **User Input:** Captured user input using the `input()` function to gather information such as username, password, task details, etc.

- **Conditional Statements:** Implemented conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control the flow of the program based on user choices and input.

- **Functions:** Defined multiple functions to encapsulate specific tasks such as user information input, task information input, task status update, etc., promoting code reusability and readability.

- **Exception Handling:** Implemented exception handling using `try-except` blocks to handle errors gracefully, such as incorrect username/password input or file-related errors.

- **Datetime Module:** Utilized the `datetime` module to get the current date and time for updating task status with timestamps.

## Features:

- **Sign-Up:** Allows new users to sign up by providing a username and password.

- **Log-In:** Existing users can log in using their username and password to access their task manager.

- **View Tasks:** Users can view their existing tasks along with their details.

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their task list, providing task descriptions and targets.

- **Update Task Status:** Users can update the status of their tasks, including completed, ongoing, and not started tasks.

## How to Use:

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - No additional installation is required.

2. **Running the Task Manager:**
   - Execute the `task_manager.py` file using Python.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to sign up or log in to the task manager.

3. **Using the Task Manager:**
   - Sign up for a new account if you're a new user or log in with your existing credentials.
   - Choose options to view tasks, add tasks, update task status, or view task status as per your requirement.
   - Follow the prompts and input the necessary information to perform the desired actions.

## Skills Demonstrated:

- **User Interaction:** Enabled user interaction through command-line input for various functionalities such as sign-up, log-in, and task management.

- **Data Persistence:** Stored user information and task data persistently using file handling techniques, ensuring data integrity across sessions.

- **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling to manage exceptions and provide informative error messages for better user experience.

- **Modular Programming:** Organized code into modular functions, each responsible for specific tasks, facilitating code maintenance and scalability.
